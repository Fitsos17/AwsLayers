# AwsLayers program by Nick üë©‚Äçüíª
This is a small shell (bash) program that downloads python libraries for you and converts them to a lambda layer.

# Prerequisites
- Upload your requirements.txt file in a bucket. Be aware that the packet size **CAN NOT EXCEED 250mb**
- Go to the iam-policy.json file and place in the "recourse" key of the second object the arn of the bucket you uploaded the requirements.txt file
- Create an IAM role that has attached the policy I uploaded (iam-policy.json).
- Modify the parameters of the shell script:
    1) PYTHON_VERSION: Specify the python version (3.11 or 3.12  <11 or >12 creates problems with yum install)
    2) S3_PATH_TO_REQUIREMENTS: Specify the URI of the requirements.txt file
    3) LAYER_NAME: Specify the name of the layer you want to create
